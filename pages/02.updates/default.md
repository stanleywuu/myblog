## Timeline of post-retirement
### Pointless browsing of reddit and youtube everyday is implied

    - Is it bad that I find l33tcode problems more interesting than work problems?
- Day 3: Got myself checked out at the chiropractor, hopefully there isn't anything major.
- Day 4: Continuing on with leetcode. The DFS and BFS are strange and magical.
- Day 5: Found some youtube tutorial for Taichi, neglecting my projects right now.
- Week #5: Time to get to work
- Day 1: Adding some fine touches to the custom library, UI page for displaying logs.
