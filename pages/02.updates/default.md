## Timeline of post-retirement
### Pointless browsing of reddit and youtube everyday is implied
- Week #9, 10, 11
   - I have discovered some new (old) games on steam and spent all my time playing, need to get back on track!!
- Week #8: Christmas
    - Day 1: Started Chiropractice adjustment on the shoulder.
      - Finishing article outlines that I accepted on Friday
- Week #7: Scared and wasted
    - Day 1: More Taichi, saw the X-Ray of my spine. Immediately paid for my chiropractic corrective program. First adjustment, neck still stiff.
    - Day 2: Scared now, really focusing on learning the Taichi moves.
    - Day 3: Adjustments and Taichi. Being very careful not to look at the screen. Bought insurance... The descent feels real now.
    - Day 4: Adjustments and Taichi, almost learned the whole set now.
    - Day 5: Taichi. Then I got bored, used WinDirStat to remove stale files from my Windows and re-downloaded steam
    - Weekend: Skipped out on lunch with ex-coworkers amid Omicron scare. Also, shoveled snow.
- Week #6: Accelerating? Oh the Irony
- Day 1: I have rediscovered "Everybody loves Raymond"... Oh boy
- Day 2: Finishing off a freelancing article. Picking up another one for December.
    - I'm spending too much time on these articles. Need to get back to my own projects
    - Is it bad that I find l33tcode problems more interesting than work problems?
- Day 3: Got myself checked out at the chiropractor, hopefully there isn't anything major.
- Day 4: Continuing on with leetcode. The DFS and BFS are strange and magical.
- Day 5: Found some youtube tutorial for Taichi, neglecting my projects right now.
    - Talking with an insurance broker to figure out what insurance I want to get, or whether I want insurance at all.
    - Very interesting because you don't think about this when you have a job, and I'm oblivious of the cost of pretty much everything I've done since they did direct billing.
- Week #5: Time to get to work
- Day 1: Adding some fine touches to the custom library, UI page for displaying logs.
- Day 3: Continued working on my freelance article. Going to the library is just so much more productive :(
- Day 4: I need to fix the name of the Open Source library
- Day 5: Started doing some l33tcode problems. I feel so dumb :(
***
- Week #4: Gearing up to release my custom library
- Day 1: Attempt to add legacy support to the Icebear library for Net5, .Net Standard
    - It is a challenge with the dependency on EF Core and EF Core 6
- Day 2 - 3: Having trouble with eyes, taking a break. Do some pushups, skip some ropes... Try to stay off youtube... yuck
- Day 4: Eyes are a bit better, started working on a new article for mapping with React Functional Components
    - Adding Repository pattern in the Icebear library to allow more flexibility in terms of persistence support &#9745;
    - Decided to add new features. It's very easy to over-complicate things when making a library
- Day 5:Published nuget package, tested with .net 5 and .net 6
- Weekend: Put on winter tires
    - This was my fourth year changing my winter tires, yet I encountered something I've never encountered before... The wheels were stuck
    - So the solution was: Drive the car around with the nuts loose
