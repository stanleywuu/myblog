## Chronical Of a Retired Software Developer
### What Is This About
This is the home of a "retired" software developer,
Who has burnt out a few times over,
So on the tenth year of his career,
He took a break and bought some beer.
Here's the chronical of his descent.
From living a comfortable life to homelessness.

### How Do You Support Yourself?
That's a good question. I will be exploring a few different options. And hopefully generate some income before I run out of money.
Currently, I still have some income from freelance tutorial writing, but $500/month is hardly sustainable.

### How Did You Get To This Stage?

*Note: Months are estimates*
