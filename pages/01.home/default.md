## Thoughts of a retired Software Developer
### Here is my career so far, a.k.a what my LinkedIn profile really says
*Note: Months are estimates*
- July 2010: Co-op job, yay!
- Sept 2011: Back to school! Can't wait to start my capstone!
- April 2012: Graduated from University, skipped convocation to go on an Interview, didn't get it. Thus abandoned my goal of doing embedded devices.
- June - August 2012: Waiting for first offer to finalize. Company was looking to do paperwork with the government
*First sign of trouble*
- September 2012: Started my first job, yay! Windows Mobile and CE! Cool! What do you mean you use C#? You don't use C++?
- December 2014: Burned out from my first job, yay!
- April 2014: New job, yay! ASP Forms? Sure, WM and CE are dying.
- November 2014: Layed off, damn!
- December 2014: New job, yay!
- December 2015: I wanna do mobile?!!
- April 2016: Why'd I pick iOS?!
- Feb 2019: I can't do this any more. I'm going to start looking, but was promised things will get better.
- April 2019: As a break, work on the web app instead.
- November 2020: Okay now I really gotta go. Boss: What if we put you on a different team on a new project?
- Oct 2021: Well, that was fun! But being the human version of a CD tool is way too exhausting.
- Nov: 2021: Retired

### Thus begins my descent to homelessness
- Week #1: Setting up the home page, starting on new project
